# Yo, I'm poli0981 👋

### Quick Bio (Spoiler: Nothing Impressive)

A 20-something (guess: 22–23?) Vietnamese dev scraping by in unremarkable youth — unemployed, mildly self-loathing, introvert on god-mode, dropped out of university year 3 (details? It's a mess 😅), mooching off family, with AI (currently Grok) as my only non-judgmental buddy. Yeah, that's the vibe.


### Skills? Mediocre at Best

- **Gaming**: Normal/Easy mode only — life's hard enough. Want to see "legendary noob plays" that go straight to hell? Hit my YouTube or X. You'll witness decision-making that buries itself in the earth's core 😂
- **Coding**: Average across the board. Knows a bit of everything (C, C++, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, Assembly?, SQL, Python, Swift... you name it), but nothing "pro" — all "kinda works" level. AI bumps it to "barely competent" 😌
- **Social Survival**: 0 friends, 0 networks. Below average (hence unemployment).

### Currently...
- Surviving on instant noodles and Steam sales
- Occasionally writing code that barely works
- Talking to AI more than real humans

If you ended up here by mistake... thanks for the visit I guess? 😅  
Repos are mostly half-finished disasters.
