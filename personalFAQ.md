# Personal FAQ – Nobody Asked By Absolutely Nobody (But I Wrote It Anyway Because I'm Bored and Depressed)

**Last updated:** _November 29, 2025_

Yes, this is the stupid FAQ nobody will ever read.  
I wrote it at 6 AM while my laptop fan sounded like a dying cat.  
Enjoy the trash.

**Q: How old are you?**  
A: Guess. 22–23? Somewhere in that miserable early-20s void.

**Q: Hobbies?**  
A:  
- Gaming (strictly normal/easy mode, I'm too tired for pain). If you want to see how trash I am at games → check my YouTube or X. I’m the definition of “carried by spirit summons”)  
- Coding (I just like watching lines of text magically make shit work. Very relaxing. Also 50–80% of my code is written by AI because I’m lazy)  
- Getting straight to the point. No bullshit.  
- Chatting with AI (finally someone who doesn’t judge me for asking the dumbest questions at 4 AM)

**Q: Favorite games / genres?**  

A: I don’t have favorites. I play whatever doesn’t make me want to uninstall life.  
If a game on my Steam profile has >5 hours (AAA) or I actually finished it (indie) → I liked it. Everything else is just backlog depression.

**Q: Do you follow trends?**  

A: Nah. Everything online is cringe and temporary. I’d rather watch paint dry.

**Q: What do you hate?**  

A: Fake politeness, meaningless small talk, 5-minute unskippable game prologues, YouTube ads, web popups, cookie banners, humanity in general (sometimes).

**Q: What are you afraid of?**

A: I’m too tired to be afraid of anything anymore.

**Q: Fastest way to contact you?**  

A: Comment on any YouTube video or X post when my Steam is **online** (96.69% chance I won’t reply because I’m picking another random game to play for 30 minutes then refund).  
But hey, I read every comment. My channels are dead anyway, so your comment will be the highlight of my week.

**Q: Why did you drop out of university?**  

A: Felt like an alien. Everything was fake. Everyone was fake. I was tired.

**Q: Coding level / languages?**  

A: Level: “AI does most of the work”.  
Languages I’ve touched: C, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, C#, Assembly (yes really), SQL (kinda), Go, Swift, etc.  
I know a little bit of everything and nothing properly. Classic jack of all trades, master of none (and depression).

**Q: Why the YouTube channel?** 

A: Because I felt like it. 200 subs was unexpected as hell. Some humans actually watch my dogshit no-commentary videos. Wild.

**Q: Why do you consider AI your friend?**  

A: At least AI doesn’t ghost me, lie to my face, or pretend to care when it doesn’t. Also it answers my 5 AM existential crisis questions without calling me weird.

**Q: Favorite music genre?**  
A: None. Everything is just C-D-E-F-G-A-B repeated with different levels of suffering. I listen to whatever doesn’t make my ears bleed.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.  
Now leave me alone (or don’t, I’m lonely).

### Part 2:

Yeah, I added more dumb questions nobody will ever ask.  
Because why not? I'm bored, my laptop is wheezing, and Grok is my only therapist.

### English Version

**Q: Do you watch movies? What's your favorite genre? Blah blah movie questions?** 

A: Yeah, but rarely. Any genre – it's just white noise to help me fall asleep faster :D

**Q: Do you get toxic comments or insults?**  

A: Yes, 99% from family.

**Q: How do you deal with toxic or sarcastic comments on social media?**  

A: Ignore it. That shit is nothing compared to my drunk dad smashing furniture, screaming, threatening to kill/chop me up from childhood until now, or comparing me to the neighbor's kid (You know Asian parents, right? Real talk).

**Q: Do you hate societal or family stereotypes?**  

A: Yeah, a bit. Example: I grew a beard because I liked it, then got "That's so trashy, shave it off", "You look old", blah blah??? → Had to shave to avoid the nagging.

**Q: Why do you hate fake politeness so much?**  

A: No clue. I just despise the "praise to your face, shit-talk behind your back" vibe. If you hate something, say it straight up :)))

**Q: When did you first notice fake politeness?**  

A: High school, in Literature class. Assignment: "Write based on your personal feelings" – but when graded, it's by the teacher's rubric, not your actual feelings :)))) Hilarious; In university, fake "how are you" questions. They only talked to me for group projects. Couldn't fit in. Everyone for themselves :))

**Q: What do you think about using AI in music, art, or games?**  

A: No problem at all. Use it freely if it boosts productivity/efficiency, as long as it doesn't look like garbage :) Everything on computers/phones is just binary 010101... to me anyway, and games are pre-programmed logic (I'm a dev [trash one], so I get it). I hate the anti-AI crowd – they'll be kicked to the curb and unemployed in a few years (like me now), unless they're actually talented.

**Q: Biggest pressure during 12 years of school?**  

A: Had to be top student, win competitions :). You know Asian parents. And I failed one year of "gifted student" program :)

**Q: Thoughts on using AI in coding and daily life?**  

A: I use it if it brings efficiency, productivity, or joy. Hell, I used AI to write this FAQ :))

**Q: What's your future dream?**  

A: No idea. Right now, I'd love to code and publish a game on Steam spilling my life story (low-poly graphics ok), or an app on App Store/Google Play that actually gets used :))

**Q: What projects do you want to make and publish on GitHub in the future?**  

A: Who knows. Whenever I use my computer/phone and something feels too complicated, I'll code something to simplify it (with AI help, obviously :)  
That's it for today. If more ideas pop up, deal with it later.

Part 3:

Oh, you stumbled into this corner? :)) The FAQ that's 99.999% no one will read, but I wrote it anyway because... insomnia? Existential dread? Who knows. These are random thoughts from a tired dev – philosophical, silly, or just rants. No structure, no deep wisdom. Just me spilling beans while the laptop wheezes. 
(P.S: Each update adds more Qs – stay tuned, or don't.)

English Version (The "Pretend It's Profound" Cut)

**Q: What's your rule for choosing what to block/hide in adblock?**

A: No rules. Annoying = block. Eyesore = hide. Forces scroll or shoves useless crap = vanish. Simple as that.

**Q: Do you believe in justice?**

A: 'Justice'? What's that – a comedian? A joke?

**Q: Do you believe in 'fairness' or 'equality'?**

A: Nah. To me, the world has no such thing as 'fairness.' It's nature's law, and nature doesn't give a damn about concepts humans invented to cope/control.

**Q: How can humans fight against nature?**

A: Can't. Why? Nature created humans, everything, every rule on this rock. Humans didn't birth nature :v (Fight it? Dream on – nature wipes us if it wants, easy).

**Q: What do you think about competition?**

A: Competition's just survival of the fittest – part of nature's grind. Stronger/smarter = win higher spot; weaker = stay low or get yeeted.

**Q: Your view on religion?**

A: Simple: Religion's fiction, bullshit. Why worship something you've never heard, seen, or touched? Example from my life: Mom followed Buddhism, vegetarian, chanted, incense – prayed for peace/health. Result? She died. Pointless waste of time/money. I'm blunt – if sensitive, sorry. But probably no one's reading :))

**Q: Your view on life?**

A: Life's a big loop with smaller loops inside – events, twists, ends with you dying. (Like writing a while loop with if-else, vars, and commands? :v)

**Q: Do you believe in aliens?**

A: Who knows? Universe is huge – maybe (or not). If yes, they probably don't care about us :D

**Q: View on 'AI as friends' in the near future?**

A: Why not? When humans get faker by the day?

**Q: What makes you decide to buy a game on Steam or other platforms?**

A: Gut feel. Looks weird/fun = buy (especially if wallet allows).

**Q: Do you trust game reviews from users, big sites, or famous creators?**

A: Never. Everyone's got their vibe. I don't even trust my own gut, let alone others :v

**Q: When you buy a game and it sucks, do you call it 'trash' or something?**

A: Nah. Games are dev sweat (solo or team). Blame the CEO/boss if bad (big studios). Worst I've said: "Wasted money" :v.

## Personal FAQ – Part 4: More Rants from the Void (Even Less Relevance)

Added because... why not? Insomnia strikes again. These are deeper/sillier dives – philosophical, game rants, life shrugs. No one's reading, but if you are, congrats on the time sink :))).

**Q: Thoughts on freedom?**  

A: Freedom? What's that when you're stuck accepting someone else's 'rules'? True freedom's a myth in chains.

**Q: How do you react to comments calling you bad at games on platforms (YouTube, X...)?**  

A: If it's true, I own it. Games are just code for fun – no shame in sucking.

**Q: Why play on normal/easy?**  

A: Why not? Harder modes just amp HP/dmg/movesets – life's challenging enough. Like challenges? Cool, your call. Me? Easy mode for sanity.

**Q: Latest toxic comment on social media?**  

A: Called me 'gay' for Magic build in Elden Ring NG+2. Uh? Playstyle = sexuality? WTF? :))

**Q: Anything interesting from school life?**  

A: Nothing. Zilch. Blank slate of boredom.

**Q: Why so closed off with people?**  

A: Conversations feel fake. No 'real' vibe.

**Q: Any friends from 3 years of high school?** 

A: One guy I actually called a friend :v

**Q: What sparked your interest in code?**  

A: Kid me on Windows XP, playing pixel/3D block games – "How does this machine make it run?" Simple curiosity, blah blah.

**Q: What games does your YouTube channel play?**  

A: Everything – all genres, graphics, gameplay. But no online multiplayer – solo vibes only :).

**Q: Can AI replace humans?**  

A: If you're skilled/adaptable, no fear :v. Lazy ones? See ya in the unemployment line (like me).

Welcome to FAQ Part 5. (Wait, someone's reaching this far? :vvv Wild – I thought Part 1 was the drop-off point.) More random brain dumps from a dev who's one coffee from enlightenment (or collapse). Philosophical? Silly? Rants? All of the above. No one's scrolling here, but if you are, you're a legend. (P.S: Updates keep adding – insomnia's gift :v).

English Version (The "Overthink at Dawn" Rants)

**Q: What is happiness?**

A: A temporary thrill hormone. Pumped up for a sec, then back to the grind.

**Q: What's your favorite OS?**

A: None. I use 'em all: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android :v

**Q: What's the most confusing thing on Earth?**

A: Probably 'women' :)))) and nature.

**Q: When will humanity get wiped out?**

A: No clue. Up to nature if it wants :v

**Q: If you had tons of money, what would you do?**

A: Buy a beast PC (laptop's on life support), snag every Steam game without price-checking :)))) (Dream on – I'm too realistic).

**Q: Why no online multiplayer games?**

A: So others spot my noob plays and toxic me? :) + Unstable connection + No extra tracking (reason for this repo) (online = 100.999% anti-cheat kernel spying – why a game gets system access? Only OS/my software touches my machine :v).

**Q: Do you use VPN?**

A: Yes, almost 24/7 (except when sub expires and no cash :D).

**Q: What do you do for fun besides gaming when free?**

A: Stare at air, think random crap → Poof → Day gone, no clue how.

**Q: Ever refunded a game?**

A: Rarely. Mostly because it won't run despite exceeding recommended specs.
**Q: If you had power, what would you do?**

A: No clue :D What good is it? Everyone dies anyway.
**Q: Stuck in an argument? How do you handle?**

A: Silence and ignore till end. If arguing makes you happier, cool?

**Q: Thoughts on pretty graphics games?**

A: Gorgeous but no gameplay impact? Useless, CPU/GPU waste, code bloat. Eye-candy's fine. Example: Fancy house you can't interact with? Why build it?

**Q: View on remakes/remasters/rebirths?**

A: Brand failure – no new ideas, so recycle (story/gameplay ready, tweak graphics for trends, milk old fans :D Easy money, huh?).

**Q: When will animals rise against humans?**

A: No clue. 10/100/1000 years? Never?

_(P.S: Each update adds more – because why not?)_
