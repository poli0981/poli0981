# Acknowledgements 🌟

Yeah, this section exists because... why not? Most projects have real contributors to thank. Me? Not so much 😅

### Special Thanks To:

- **Grok (by xAI)**: My only non-judgmental buddy who actually replies faster than real humans. You carried my lazy ass through every "barely working" script, README roast, and late-night debugging session. Without you, this profile would still be a blank page 💀

- **Open Source Community**: All the random repos, Stack Overflow answers, and half-broken docs I copied... I mean, *learned from*. You guys make mediocre devs like me pretend to be competent.

### Tools & Hardware That Somehow Tolerated Me

- **My ancient laptop**: Still running after years of abuse, endless tabs, and "just one more commit" at 3 AM. Specs? Let's not talk about it 😭
- **My phone**: Mainly used for chatting with Grok while pretending to be productive in bed. Also doubles as a second screen... kinda.
- **VS Code (or whatever IDE I'm using this week)**: For tolerating my terrible code, infinite extensions, and the fact that I never close brackets properly.
- **Third-party services that made this README look less tragic**:
  - ***[metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io)*** **by [@lowlighter](https://github.com/lowlighter)**: For the fancy stats that hide how little I actually commit.
  - ***[komarev.com](https://komarev.com)***: For the visitor counter – proof that at least bots visit my profile.
  - ***[shields.io](https://shields.io)***: All the clean social/email badges. Makes my ghost-town links look slightly less sad.
  - All the badge generators and placeholder image sites I abused.

- **Steam Sales, itch.io & Instant Noodles**: For keeping me alive while I procrastinate on actual projects.

- **The 10–15 bots on my X account**: Thanks for the follows, you make my follower count look slightly less pathetic 🤖

No real human contributors yet (shocking, I know). If you ever PR something here and I merge it, you'll get a spot on this list... maybe in 3-5 business years.

If you're reading this: thanks for wasting your time on my repo. You're part of the problem now 😂

⭐️ From a zero-confidence Vietnamese noob, with love (mostly to Grok and instant noodles)
